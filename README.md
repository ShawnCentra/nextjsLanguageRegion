# nextjsLanguageRegion

Quick repo to test implementation 

middleware needs to be set up to handle redirections when
- the url doesnt have the language/region set (defaults to en / bc) 
- the url only has one or the other ( region or language.. should set the other to default)
- / should show defaults? or show nothing?


basic implementation of lang + region with conditional rendering page using lang + region 
might be more cases to consider
